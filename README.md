## Description

In this project, we have created a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things: books, music albums, movies, and games. The data will be stored in JSON files. We created a database with PostgreSQL and built the console interactivity with Ruby.

The app allows you to:

- Add new books, music album and game.
- Add relating labels, genre and authors.
- Save data into json files.
- Pick up where you left by reading back json data into the app.
